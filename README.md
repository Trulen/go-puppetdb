## Background

## Installation

import (
  "github.com/akira/go-puppetdb"
)
```

Create a Client with PuppetDB Hostname:

resp, err := client.Nodes()
...
resp, err := client.NodeFacts("node123")
...
```


Queries can be represented as an array of strings and turned into JSON:

```go
query, err := puppetdb.QueryToJson([]string{"=", "report", "aef00"})
resp, res_err := client.Events(query, nil)
```
